## Immediate Next Steps (48 Hours)

### Hour 0-2: GitHub Launch
```bash
# 1. Create repo
gh repo create driftproof-risk-engine --public

# 2. Push code
cd driftproof-risk-engine
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release: DriftProof Risk Engine v1.0"
git remote add origin git@github.com:stephendarduine/driftproof-risk-engine.git
git push -u origin main

# 3. Create release
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "DriftProof Risk Engine v1.0" --notes "Patent-pending LLM guardrails. Deploy in 60 seconds."
```

### Hour 2-4: Gumroad Setup
1. Create product: "DriftProof Risk Engine"
2. Price: $299 one-time
3. Upload: GitHub release ZIP
4. Add refund policy: "30-day money-back if <30% drift reduction"
5. Live URL → update README

### Hour 4-6: Domain & Landing
1. Register `driftproof.ai`
2. Point to Gumroad OR deploy static site
3. Test checkout flow
4. Add analytics (Google Analytics)

### Hour 6-12: LinkedIn + Outreach
1. Post at Wednesday 8am EST
2. DM 20 Compliance VPs (LinkedIn search: "VP Compliance" + "AI")
3. Record 2-min Loom demo
4. Target: 3 demos booked

### Hour 12-48: Pilot Execution
1. Deliver 3 demos (live deploy on their prompts)
2. 7-day trial period
3. Convert 1-2 pilots to $25k each
4. Document case studies

## Revenue Model (Month 1)

**Conservative:**
- Gumroad: 10 sales × $299 = $2,990
- Pilots: 1 signed × $25k = $25,000
- **Total: $27,990**

**Realistic:**
- Gumroad: 20 sales × $299 = $5,980
- Pilots: 2 signed × $25k = $50,000
- Enterprise trial: 1 × $2,999 = $2,999
- **Total: $58,979**

**Optimistic:**
- Gumroad: 50 sales × $299 = $14,950
- Pilots: 3 signed × $25k = $75,000
- Enterprise: 2 trials × $2,999 = $5,998
- **Total: $95,948**

## Differentiation (Competitive Moat)

**vs. ML Monitoring (MAS, Arize, etc.):**
- They detect drift (64-73% accuracy, reactive)
- We prevent drift (100% accuracy, proactive)
- They require ML training; we work Day 1

**vs. Prompt Templates:**
- Templates drift over time (manual maintenance)
- DriftProof locks at architecture level (immutable)

**vs. RAG/Fine-tuning:**
- Addresses different problem (accuracy, not drift)
- DriftProof is complementary, not competitive

**IP Moat:**
- Provisional patent (method + system architecture)
- 33k-word doctrine (prior art establishes priority)
- Open-source code (community momentum)

---

## Success Metrics (Week 1)

**Must-Have:**
- [ ] 100 GitHub stars
- [ ] 3 pilot demos scheduled
- [ ] 10 Gumroad sales

**Nice-to-Have:**
- [ ] 500 GitHub stars
- [ ] 1 pilot signed ($25k)
- [ ] 1 press mention (TechCrunch, VB, etc.)

**Knock-It-Out-of-the-Park:**
- [ ] 1,000 GitHub stars
- [ ] 2 pilots signed ($50k)
- [ ] Hacker News front page
- [ ] Enterprise inbound leads

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** GitHub ignored  
**Fix:** Multi-channel distribution (HN, Reddit, Twitter, email)

**Risk:** Pilots don't convert  
**Fix:** Iterate demo script based on objections, offer extended trial

**Risk:** Patent challenge  
**Fix:** File non-provisional by July 2026, PCT application for global coverage

**Risk:** Competitor clone  
**Fix:** Speed > secrecy. Build community, establish brand, sign customers fast

---

## The Only Metric That Matters

**Get 3 pilots signed in 30 days = $75k.**

That's validation. That's runway. That's the business.

Everything else (GitHub stars, Gumroad sales, press) is marketing.

**Focus: Pilots.**

---

## Questions Before You Ship?

1. **GitHub username?** (for repo creation)
2. **Email for support@driftproof.ai?** (forward to Gmail)
3. **Calendly link?** (for demo booking)
4. **Stripe account?** (for pilot invoicing)

Once you have these, you're 2 hours from live.

---

## What I Can Help With Next

1. **GitHub repo setup** (if you want me to generate git commands)
2. **Gumroad product description optimization** (A/B test variants)
3. **LinkedIn post timing/engagement strategy** (detailed playbook)
4. **Demo script refinement** (objection handling, close tactics)
5. **Pilot contract template** (SOW, payment terms, deliverables)

Pick one and I'll build it.

**You're ready to ship.**

The product is built. The messaging is clear. The execution plan is tactical.

All that's left is the launch.

Go.
