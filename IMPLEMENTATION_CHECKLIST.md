## Success Metrics (48 Hours)

**Minimum Viable:**
- [ ] 100 GitHub stars
- [ ] 10 Gumroad sales ($3k revenue)
- [ ] 3 pilot demos scheduled ($75k potential)

**Stretch Goals:**
- [ ] 500 GitHub stars
- [ ] 25 Gumroad sales ($7.5k revenue)
- [ ] 5 pilots signed ($125k closed)
- [ ] 1 press mention (TechCrunch, VentureBeat, etc.)

---

## Week 2 Priorities (After 48-Hour Launch)

1. **Convert pilots to paid:** 3 pilots × $25k = $75k
2. **Scale Gumroad:** A/B test landing page, optimize conversion
3. **Content marketing:** Weekly blog post on drift prevention
4. **Enterprise demos:** 5 per week (40% close rate = 2 new customers/week)
5. **GitHub community:** Respond to issues, accept PRs, build momentum

---

## Tools Needed

- [ ] GitHub account
- [ ] Gumroad account
- [ ] LinkedIn Premium (for outreach)
- [ ] Loom (for demo videos)
- [ ] Calendly (for booking demos)
- [ ] Stripe (for pilot invoicing)
- [ ] Domain registrar account

---

## Budget (First Month)

- Domain: $12/year
- Loom Pro: $10/mo
- LinkedIn Premium: $60/mo
- Calendly Pro: $12/mo
- **Total:** ~$100/mo

**ROI if you hit minimums:**
- Revenue: $3k (Gumroad) + $75k (pilots) = $78k
- Costs: $100
- Profit: $77,900

---

## Emergency Contacts

**If something breaks:**
- GitHub issues: Public troubleshooting
- Email: support@driftproof.ai (set up inbox)
- Backup: Text/call if server down

**If pilot goes sideways:**
- Offer full refund immediately
- Ask for feedback
- Fix issue within 24 hours
- Re-engage with fixed version

---

## What Could Go Wrong (Risk Mitigation)

**Risk:** GitHub repo gets ignored  
**Mitigation:** Post in 5+ communities simultaneously, leverage personal network

**Risk:** Demos don't convert  
**Mitigation:** Record every demo, iterate script, A/B test messaging

**Risk:** Gumroad sales = 0  
**Mitigation:** Focus on pilots instead ($25k > $299), use Gumroad as lead gen

**Risk:** Compliance VP says "we already solved this"  
**Mitigation:** "Great! How are you measuring drift? Can I see your verification framework?" (They don't have one)

---

## The Only Thing That Matters

**Get 3 pilots signed in 7 days.**

Everything else is noise.

If you get 3 × $25k pilots → you have $75k + validation + case studies.

That's the entire business.

GitHub stars are vanity. Gumroad is nice-to-have. **Pilots are the game.**

Focus there.
