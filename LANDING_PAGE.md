## Problem Section

### Every Enterprise Has This Problem

Your LLM agents drift:
- ❌ Medical triage bots start diagnosing
- ❌ Legal Q&A systems give advice
- ❌ Support agents make unauthorized promises
- ❌ Compliance tools hallucinate regulations

**Result:** $1M+ fines. Lost customer trust. Endless prompt engineering firefights.

**Root cause:** LLMs absorb context and gradually reinterpret their mission.

You can't fix this with monitoring. By the time you detect drift, damage is done.

---

## Solution Section

### DriftProof: Architectural Prevention

We don't monitor drift. We make it **structurally impossible**.

**Six Behavioral Invariants:**

1. **Identity Lock** — System never forgets what it is
2. **Mission Lock** — Purpose cannot shift or expand
3. **Constraint Cage** — Hard boundaries enforced
4. **Format Lock** — Output structure never collapses
5. **Interpretive Invariance** — Context filtered, not absorbed
6. **Operator Invariance** — Your sovereignty preserved

**How it works:**
```bash
# Deploy locked prompt
./deploy.sh

# Verify every output
python verify/drift_check.py
→ PASS or DRIFT DETECTED
```

**No ML training. No statistical guessing. Just architectural impossibility.**

## Differentiation Section

### Why DriftProof Beats Monitoring

| Approach | DriftProof | ML Monitoring | Prompt Templates |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Accuracy** | 100% (structural) | 64-73% (statistical) | Variable (manual) |
| **Latency** | 0ms overhead | 1.2ms per call | 0ms |
| **Training Required** | None | Model retraining | None |
| **Prevents Drift** | Yes (architectural) | No (detects after) | No (drifts over time) |
| **Day 1 Ready** | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ |

**Bottom line:** We remove the drift pathway. Others try to catch it after it happens.

## FAQ Section

**Q: How is this different from prompt engineering?**  
A: Prompt engineering is manual vigilance. DriftProof is architectural impossibility. Your prompts drift over time. Our lockfiles don't.

**Q: Do I need ML expertise?**  
A: No. If you can run a bash script, you can deploy DriftProof. Zero ML required.

**Q: What LLMs does this work with?**  
A: All of them. GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Gemini — if it accepts system prompts, DriftProof works.

**Q: Can I customize the lockfiles?**  
A: Yes. Edit `variables.json` → redeploy. Takes 30 seconds.

**Q: What if my LLM ignores the prompt?**  
A: Runtime verification catches this. `drift_check.py` flags violations immediately.

**Q: Is this overkill for creative apps?**  
A: Yes. DriftProof is for compliance-critical systems. If you want creative flexibility, don't use this.

**Q: What's the ROI?**  
A: One avoided compliance violation = $1M+ fine. DriftProof costs $299/mo.

## Gumroad Product Description

**Title:** DriftProof Risk Engine — LLM Guardrails That Actually Work

**Short Description:**  
Architectural LLM guardrails. Deploy in 60 seconds. Make prompt drift structurally impossible.

**Long Description:**

Every enterprise deploying LLMs faces the same problem: agents drift.

Your medical triage bot starts diagnosing. Your legal Q&A system gives advice. Your support agent makes unauthorized promises.

Traditional solutions (monitoring, RAG, fine-tuning) detect drift after damage is done.

**DriftProof prevents it architecturally.**

This package includes:
✅ Complete lockfile framework (bash + Python)
✅ 33,000-word doctrine (theory + practice)
✅ Quick start guide (5-minute deployment)
✅ Runtime verification (`drift_check.py`)
✅ Compliance playbook template
✅ MIT License (full commercial use)

**What you get:**
- `deploy.sh` — One-command assembly
- Six behavioral invariants (Identity, Mission, Constraint, Format, Interpretive, Operator)
- Drift detection that works Day 1 (no ML training)
- Patent-pending methodology (U.S. 63/905,582)

**Who needs this:**
- Compliance teams (medical/legal/financial AI)
- Customer support with LLM agents
- Anyone who's lost sleep over prompt drift

**Who doesn't:**
- You want creative AI with no boundaries
- You're happy with 64-73% drift detection accuracy

**Price:** $299 one-time (includes lifetime updates + email support)

**Refund policy:** 30-day money-back guarantee. If DriftProof doesn't reduce format violations by 30%+, full refund.
