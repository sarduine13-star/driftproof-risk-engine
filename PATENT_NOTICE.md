# Patent Notice

## U.S. Provisional Patent Application

**Application Number:** 63/905,582  
**Filing Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Inventor:** Stephen A. Arduine  
**Docket Number:** RED-DPP-2025-PROV  
**Title:** Drift-Proof Prompt Engineering System for AI Output Control

---

## Patent Status

This technology is **Patent Pending** under U.S. provisional patent law (37 CFR 1.53(c)).

**Protection Term:** 12 months from filing date (expires October 26, 2026)  
**Non-Provisional Filing Deadline:** July 26, 2026 (recommended to preserve priority)

---

## What Is Protected

The provisional patent application covers:

1. **Computer-implemented method** for preventing behavioral drift in AI systems through:
   - Defining behavioral invariants via structured lockfiles
   - Injecting invariants into prompt templates via variable substitution
   - Runtime verification of output compliance with invariant constraints

2. **System architecture** comprising:
   - Identity Lock mechanism (non-mutable self-definition)
   - Mission Lock mechanism (immutable purpose enforcement)
   - Constraint Cage (hard operational boundaries)
   - Format Lock (structural output requirements)
   - Interpretive Invariance (doctrine-filtered context processing)
   - Operator Invariance (sovereignty preservation)

3. **Verification framework** for detecting deviation from behavioral invariants in real-time

---

## Prior Art Established

The following materials establish **priority date** and **reduction to practice**:

- **SSRN Publication:** "DriftProof: A Doctrine of Invariance for Adaptive Systems" (33,000 words)
- **GitHub Repository:** driftproof-risk-engine (open-source implementation)
- **USPTO Filing:** Provisional Application No. 63/905,582

These collectively demonstrate:
- Novel approach to LLM stability (not statistical monitoring)
- Working implementation (bash scripts + Python verification)
- Comprehensive doctrinal framework (theory + practice)

---

## License Grant

The MIT License (see LICENSE file) grants permission to use the **code implementation** of this patented technology.

**However:**
- Commercial deployments at enterprise scale may require additional licensing
- The patent covers the **method** and **system architecture**, not just the code
- Attribution and proper patent notice are required in derivative works

---

## For Commercial Users

If you are deploying DriftProof in a commercial product or service:

1. **Open-source/research use:** MIT License covers you (no additional license needed)
2. **Internal enterprise deployment:** Contact enterprise@driftproof.ai for volume licensing
3. **SaaS/product integration:** Contact patent@driftproof.ai for commercial licensing terms

We believe in open innovation + fair compensation. The code is free. The method may require licensing at scale.

## Non-Provisional Filing Strategy

**Target filing date:** July 2026  
**Scope expansion planned:**
- Extended claims for multi-agent governance systems
- Automated drift remediation methods
- Enterprise compliance telemetry integration
- Cross-model portability (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)

**International filings planned:**
- PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) application for global coverage
- Direct national filings in EU, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan
