**Shipped: DriftProof Risk Engine v1.0**

Every enterprise deploying LLMs has the same problem:

Agents drift. Prompts decay. Guardrails fail.

Your medical triage bot starts diagnosing.  
Your legal Q&A system starts giving advice.  
Your support agent starts making promises you can't keep.

15-30% effectiveness lost. $1M+ compliance fines. Endless prompt engineering firefights.

**We solved it architecturally.**

DriftProof makes drift structurally impossible through six behavioral invariants:
- Identity Lock (system never forgets what it is)
- Mission Lock (purpose cannot shift)
- Constraint Cage (hard boundaries, not suggestions)
- Format Lock (output structure never collapses)
- Interpretive Invariance (context filtered, not absorbed)
- Operator Invariance (sovereignty preserved)

**Deploy in 60 seconds:**
```
chmod +x deploy.sh && ./deploy.sh
```

**Test on your worst agent:**
```
echo "Patient chest pain" | your-llm | python verify/drift_check.py
→ PASS or DRIFT DETECTED
```

No ML training. No statistical monitoring. No reactive patches.

Just architectural impossibility.

**Open source + patent pending.**

Built for compliance VPs who are tired of playing whack-a-mole with hallucinations.

**Who needs this:**
✅ Medical/Legal/Financial AI teams  
✅ Customer support with LLM agents  
✅ Anyone who's lost sleep over prompt drift  

**Who doesn't:**
❌ You want flexible, creative AI with no rules  
❌ You're happy with 64-73% drift detection accuracy  
❌ You think "just monitor it" is a strategy  

---

**Immediate value:**
- $299/mo for 10 agents (launches Friday)
- $25k professional services (3 spots this month)
- F500 pilots: DM for same-week setup

Compliance teams: Stop patching. Start preventing.

**Comments strategy:**
Pin this: "First 50 GitHub stars get early access to Enterprise tier pricing. Link in profile."

Respond to "how is this different from prompt engineering?" with:
"Prompt engineering is manual vigilance. DriftProof is architectural impossibility. Your prompt drifts over time. Our lockfiles don't."
